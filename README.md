## Hello there! 🪷
🌕 My name is Linh and I'm new to Github - currently trying to learn all the tools haha  
🌃 I'm an aspiring Software Engineer studying at the University of Queensland.  
I enjoy coding and working on projects because I love problem solving! Hoping to learn a lot from this platform :D  
💡 I'm relatively proficient at Python, some experience in C, little in C++ from working with an Arduino, and I am a beginner to Java.\n
