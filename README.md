## Hello there! ðŸª·
ðŸŒ• My name is Linh and I'm new to Github - currently trying to learn all the tools haha  
ðŸŒƒ I'm an aspiring Software Engineer studying at the University of Queensland.
I enjoy coding and working on projects because I love problem solving! Hoping to learn a lot from this platform :D
ðŸ’¡ I'm relatively proficient at Python, and I have a little experience with C++ from working with an Arduino.
